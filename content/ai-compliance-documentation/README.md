## Key Concept

The messy, day-to-day tactical work of AI project management is actually the exact evidence auditors look for. The goal isn't to create new work for compliance, but to ensure existing project artifacts are "framework-ready."

Most teams are already creating compliance artifacts—they just don't realize it.

## Framework Coverage

- **ISO 42001:2023** - AI Management Systems
- **NIST AI RMF** - AI Risk Management Framework
- **EU AI Act** - European Union AI Regulation

## Using the Template

The CSV template includes example records for:
- Risk assessments with scoring
- Trade-off decisions
- Audit findings and corrective actions
- Competence/training records
- Management review documentation
- Incident records

Import into your preferred project management tool and customize fields as needed.
