# LinkedIn Carousel: AI Compliance Documentation

## Carousel Title
**"Your Jira Tickets Are Compliance Artifacts (You Just Don't Know It Yet)"**

---

## Slide 1: Hook
**Visual:** Split image - messy project board on left, organized compliance binder on right, with equals sign between them

**Headline:** You're Already Doing AI Compliance

**Body:** That risk discussion in your standup? That trade-off decision in your design doc? That Jira ticket tracking a bias issue?

They're all compliance evidence.

You just need to capture them right.

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
**Visual:** Person drowning in documents labeled "ISO 42001," "NIST AI RMF," "EU AI Act"

**Headline:** The Compliance Documentation Myth

**Body:** Most teams think compliance means:
- Creating new documentation
- Separate governance processes
- "Compliance theater" that doesn't add value

Wrong.

The gap isn't in doing the work. It's in capturing it.

---

## Slide 3: The Insight
**Visual:** Lightbulb moment - project artifact transforming into audit evidence

**Headline:** The Lightbulb Moment

**Body:** Auditors don't want special compliance documents.

They want evidence that you:
- Identified risks
- Made informed decisions
- Implemented controls
- Monitored outcomes

Your daily project work IS this evidence.

---

## Slide 4: The Mapping
**Visual:** Simple two-column table with arrows connecting items

**Headline:** What You Call It vs. What Auditors Call It

| Your Term | Compliance Term |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Risk brainstorm | Risk identification (ISO 6.1.2) |
| Priority scoring | Risk evaluation (NIST MEASURE) |
| Mitigation ticket | Risk treatment (ISO 6.1.3) |
| Design decision | Trade-off documentation |
| Sprint retro | Continuous improvement |

---

## Slide 5: The Three Elements
**Visual:** Triangle diagram with Traceability, Review Evidence, and Rationale at each point

**Headline:** 3 Things That Make Artifacts Audit-Ready

**1. Traceability**
Can you link this to a specific AI system?

**2. Evidence of Review**
Did someone with authority approve it?

**3. The "Why"**
Is the rationale documented?

Without these, it's just project noise.

---

## Slide 6: Real Example - Risk Scoring
**Visual:** Screenshot-style mockup of a risk matrix

**Headline:** Example: Your 5x5 Risk Matrix

**What you're doing:**
Scoring risks on likelihood and impact

**What it satisfies:**
- ISO 42001 Clause 6.1.2 (Risk assessment methodology)
- NIST AI RMF MEASURE-2 (Metrics tracked)
- EU AI Act Article 9 (Risk management system)

**What to preserve:**
- The scoring rubric (what does a "4" mean?)
- Who assigned scores and when
- The rationale for each score

---

## Slide 7: Real Example - Trade-off Decision
**Visual:** Decision matrix comparing options

**Headline:** Example: Accuracy vs. Explainability

**What you're doing:**
Choosing between model options in a design meeting

**What it satisfies:**
- ISO 42001 Annex A.6.2.6 (Trade-offs documentation)
- NIST AI RMF MANAGE-4 (Trade-offs managed)
- EU AI Act Article 14 (Human oversight)

**What to preserve:**
- Options considered
- Decision criteria
- Who decided and why
- Conditions for revisiting

---

## Slide 8: The Minimum Fields
**Visual:** Clean form/template mockup

**Headline:** Essential Fields for Any System

Every risk/artifact record needs:

- **AI System ID** (traceability)
- **Owner** (accountability - name, not role)
- **Approver** (authority)
- **Framework mapping** (ISO clause, NIST function)
- **Rationale** (the "why")
- **Dates** (created, updated, reviewed)
- **Evidence links** (supporting docs)

Works in Jira, Linear, Asana, or spreadsheets.

---

## Slide 9: Common Gaps
**Visual:** Checklist with X marks on common failures

**Headline:** Where Teams Usually Fail

- Risks scored without documented criteria
- Decisions made without recorded rationale
- Tickets closed without effectiveness verification
- No point-in-time snapshots (only current state)
- "The team" as owner instead of named individual
- Risk accepted but no approval trail

These gaps sink audits.

---

## Slide 10: Call to Action
**Visual:** Clean, professional - perhaps the TAIGR logo or Jose's headshot

**Headline:** Start Today

**Three steps:**
1. Audit your current artifacts - what exists?
2. Add the three elements - traceability, review, rationale
3. Map to frameworks - know what each artifact proves

Your daily work is your compliance evidence.

Treat it that way.

**Engagement prompt for caption:**
"What's the most overlooked compliance artifact in your AI projects? I'll go first: trade-off decisions. Teams make them constantly but rarely document why they chose Option A over Option B."

**Hook variations for A/B testing:**
- "Your Jira tickets are worth more than you think"
- "Stop creating 'compliance documentation'"
- "An auditor's favorite evidence isn't what you expect"
- "The ISO 42001 artifacts you're already creating"
