# Executive Summary: AI Project Documentation for Compliance

## The Core Insight

Most AI teams are already creating the artifacts that ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF, and EU AI Act compliance requires—they just don't realize it. The risk discussions in standups, the trade-off decisions in design meetings, the Jira tickets tracking mitigation work, and the dashboards monitoring model performance are all potential compliance evidence. The gap isn't in doing the work; it's in capturing it with the right metadata, approval trails, and retention practices to make it auditable. Rather than creating separate "compliance documentation," organizations should focus on making their existing project artifacts framework-ready.

## What This Means Practically

Three elements transform project artifacts into governance evidence. First, traceability: every artifact must link to a specific AI system, model version, or decision point. Second, evidence of review: documented approval from someone with appropriate authority—a named individual, not just "the team." Third, the rationale: context explaining why scores were assigned, why decisions were made, and what factors were considered. Without these elements, a risk register is just a list; with them, it's proof of due diligence.

## The Business Case

Organizations pursuing ISO 42001 certification, demonstrating NIST AI RMF alignment, or preparing for EU AI Act obligations can significantly reduce compliance effort by retrofitting existing practices rather than building parallel documentation systems. The approach is platform-agnostic—whether teams use Jira, Linear, Asana, or spreadsheets, the same principles apply. The result is compliance that emerges from operational work rather than being bolted on afterward, creating sustainable governance practices that scale with AI adoption.
