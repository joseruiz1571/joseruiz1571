# Hey, I'm Jose

I'm a librarian based in Austin, Texas. After 15+ years in information governance and operations, I'm now focused on AI Security.

I build to learn. My GitHub is organized around three kinds of experimentation: hands-on exploration of AI failure modes, AI governance observability experiments, and information products that translate daily project artifacts into compliance frameworks like ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF, and the EU AI Act.

Building teaches you what reading can't.
