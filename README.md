## 👋 Hi, I'm Jose

I'm an aspiring **Cybersecurity GRC professional** based in **Austin, TX**, transitioning from a leadership role in public libraries to a career in **cyber risk, strategy, and governance**.

🎓 I recently completed the **Cybersecurity GRC Mastery** training, where I:
- Conducted a **cybersecurity maturity assessment** using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**
- Led a **risk assessment** of a web application using the **CIA Triad**

🔍 With a background in public service and team management, I bring strong **analytical**, **communication**, and **leadership** skills to my cybersecurity journey.

💡 I'm especially interested in opportunities in:
- **Cyber Risk Management**
- **Privacy & Compliance**
- **Security Strategy**
