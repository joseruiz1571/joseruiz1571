# Hey, I'm Jose

I'm a librarian based in Austin, Texas. After 15+ years in information governance and operations, I'm now focused on **AI Security**.

## What I'm Working On

I'm developing **Threat-Informed AI Governance (TIAG)**—a methodology that integrates threat modeling frameworks like MITRE ATLAS with AI risk standards like NIST AI RMF. The goal is simple: identify vulnerabilities in AI systems before they go live by bridging the gap between compliance requirements and technical implementation.

This GitHub is where I build and learn in public.
