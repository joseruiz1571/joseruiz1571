üëã Hi, I'm Jose
An analytical and results-driven Cybersecurity GRC professional based in Austin, TX, leveraging a strong background in public library leadership to excel in cyber risk, strategy, and governance. My unique experience in public service and team management has cultivated exceptional analytical, communication, and leadership skills, directly applicable to building robust security programs.

I'm actively seeking entry-level GRC opportunities, particularly within healthcare or government sectors, but am open to all environments where I can contribute to enhancing an organization's security posture. My hands-on training (Cybersecurity GRC Mastery) and comprehensive certifications have equipped me with practical expertise in areas such as NIST CSF assessments, risk management, and compliance.

Explore my projects and certifications below to see my practical application of these skills!
