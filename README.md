# Hey, I'm Jose

I'm a librarian based in Austin, Texas. After 15+ years in information governance and operations, I'm now focused on **AI security and governance**—helping organizations deploy AI responsibly.

## What I'm Working On

I'm developing a methodology I call **Threat-Informed AI Governance (TIAG)**—combining threat modeling frameworks like MITRE ATLAS with AI risk standards (NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001) to identify vulnerabilities before systems go live.

This GitHub is where I build tools and learn in public.
