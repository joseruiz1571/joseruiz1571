# Jose Ruiz-Vazquez  
**GRC & Third-Party Risk Professional | ISO 27001 & 42001 Lead Auditor**

I design trust through clear systems and information governance.

For over 15 years, I've built and maintained environments where organizations can manage risk, ensure compliance, and make confident decisions. My work centers on **governance frameworks, risk management, and human-centered security** – translating complex requirements into practical, sustainable programs.

Now I'm applying that expertise to **cybersecurity GRC and third-party risk management (TPRM)**, with specialized focus on **AI governance, identity management, and vendor assurance**.

## 🪞 Philosophy

> "Building trust through clarity, structure, and governance."

I believe effective security and risk management starts with clear communication, well-designed processes, and systems that enable people to make informed decisions. Whether auditing an AI system, assessing vendor risk, or designing governance frameworks, I focus on practical solutions that balance security, compliance, and operational reality.
