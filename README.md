# Jose Ruiz-Vazquez
**AI Governance & Risk Professional | Threat-Informed AI Governance (TIAG)**

I design AI governance frameworks that balance innovation with risk management.

With 15+ years in information governance and operations leadership, I help organizations deploy AI responsibly through systematic risk assessment, control design, and regulatory alignment. My approach integrates threat modeling (MITRE ATLAS) with AI risk frameworks (NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001) to identify and mitigate AI risks before deployment.

## 🎯 Current Focus
- AI governance roles in financial services, healthcare, or technology sectors
- Building risk management programs that enable safe AI adoption
- Part-time AI Trainer at DataAnnotation (evaluating LLM outputs for safety and accuracy)
- Austin Public Library AI Implementation Team (Oct 2025) - establishing AI adoption guidelines

## 📁 Featured Projects

### [AI Chatbot Risk Assessment – Financial Services](projects/ai-chatbot-risk-assessment/README.md)
Comprehensive risk assessment for customer-facing AI chatbot using TIAG methodology. Integrates NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001, MITRE ATLAS threat modeling, and financial services regulatory requirements (GLBA, SOX, FCRA). Includes data flow diagrams, threat identification, control gap analysis, and residual risk evaluation.

### [ISO 42001 to AWS Services Mapping](projects/iso42001-aws-mapping)
Python script mapping ISO/IEC 42001:2023 AI Management System controls to 52 AWS services. Demonstrates practical control implementation using cloud-native capabilities across AI/ML platform (SageMaker), data governance (Lake Formation), security (IAM, KMS, Macie), and monitoring (CloudWatch, Audit Manager). Generates compliance mappings in JSON, CSV, and Markdown formats.

**Skills:** ISO 42001 · AWS Architecture · Cloud Compliance · AI Governance · Python

### [Home Network Security Scanner](projects/home-network-security-scanner)
Python tool for home network security assessment. Discovers devices via ARP scanning, identifies IoT devices and risky services (Telnet, SMB, RDP), performs quantitative risk scoring (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), and provides prioritized remediation recommendations. Exports results in JSON/CSV formats for tracking and analysis.

**Skills:** Network Security · Vulnerability Assessment · Python · Risk Scoring · Security Operations

### [Cybersecurity Program Design – NIST Framework](projects/nist-program-design)
