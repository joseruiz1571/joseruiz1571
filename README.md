# Jose Ruiz-Vazquez
**AI Governance & Risk Professional | Threat-Informed AI Risk Management (TIAG)**

I design AI governance frameworks that balance innovation with risk management.

With 15+ years in information governance and operations leadership, I help organizations deploy AI responsibly through systematic risk assessment, control design, and regulatory alignment. My approach integrates threat modeling (MITRE ATLAS) with AI risk frameworks (NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001) to identify and mitigate AI risks before deployment.

## 🎯 Current Focus
- AI governance roles in financial services, healthcare, or technology sectors
- Building risk management programs that enable safe AI adoption
- Part-time AI Trainer at DataAnnotation (evaluating LLM outputs for safety and accuracy)
- Austin Public Library AI Implementation Team (Jan 2026) - establishing AI adoption guidelines
