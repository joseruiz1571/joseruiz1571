# Home Network Security Scanner - Requirements
# Python 3.6+ required

# No external Python packages required for MVP!
# The script uses only Python standard library for maximum compatibility

# Optional system tools (recommended for best results):
# - nmap: Network discovery and port scanning
# - arp-scan: Fast ARP-based device discovery (requires sudo)
#
# Installation on different platforms:
#
# Ubuntu/Debian:
#   sudo apt-get install nmap arp-scan
#
# macOS (using Homebrew):
#   brew install nmap arp-scan
#
# The script will work with just the 'arp' command (built into most systems)
# but results will be limited to devices in the ARP cache.
